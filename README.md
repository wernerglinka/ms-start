## Overview

This Node.js-based CLI utility is designed to scaffolds frontmatter for source pages tailored for Metalsmith. Through an interactive prompt, it builds the frontmatter, subsequently writing this data to a designated file.

Originally developed for the "Metalsmith First" starter project, its adaptability allows for compatibility with any project built on the Metalsmith/Nunjucks stack. The utility operates on the assumption that pages solely employ frontmatter objects for their definition.

## Current Status

Please note: This utility is actively under development. The creation process serves a dual purpose: assisting with my personal projects while furthering my understanding of Node.js. Though there may exist more refined methods to achieve its goals, the learning journey and process have been incredibly rewarding. Documentation will be available once development is complete.
